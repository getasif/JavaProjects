A couple of guidelines/rules:
1. I will put most of my programming assignments from my various CS classes I took in college or self taught. 
2. All of the assignments are my own work unless stated otherwise. 
3. They are for reference only for myself and for others.
4. Please don't copy them without giving me due credit.
